## **Questionnarie**
1. Short cuts that taken during this project implementation due to timelimit are simple webpage design, inflexible functions, and not fully optimized in term of memory and time.
2. Even though this project is pretty simple, but it still requires both frontend and backend to work closely with each other. I don't belive any part of this project is over-designed because during implementation I was trying my best to keep the development as simple as possible.
3. If this webpage has 100 users/sec traffic, then I will have to optimize the web scraping part of server-side implementation. Since I use Puppeteer to read cryptocurrency prices from dynamic pages, I have to somehow avoid duplicated-reading cryptocurrency prices from same exchange platform if multiple users are requesting the samething.
4. To make this project more practical in real life, I will add more exchanges/sources and cryptocurrencies. If I am a big fan of selling/buying cryptocurrency, then I probably I want to compare the selling and buying prices of bitcoin across mutiple exchange platforms. In such way I can optimize the profit I can make.
